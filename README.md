# Advent of Code

Each year I use (or at least try to use) different programming language

In addition, each year contains script for downloading input, that will also create folder with day number and put input file there

Note: you need cookie session token ("Cookie: session=COOKIE_SESSION_TOKEN") to download input (you can find it by going to "Network" tab in the Developer Tools in browser and inspecting one of requests after you log in to AoC page), put it in `aoc_cookie.txt` file

## Plans

Note: the list (and order) can change

Other possible languages: Elm / D / Odin / Julia / OCaml / Clojure

Rather not: Janet / Perl / C#

| Year | Language | Alternative | Note                 |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| 2022 | Nim      | Pony        | interesting          |
| 2021 | Rust     | Zig         | relatively low-level |
| 2020 | Go       | Dart        | created by Google    |
| 2019 | Elixir   | TypeScript  | interesting          |
| 2018 | Kotlin   | Scala       | Java derivatives     |
| 2017 | Crystal  | Ruby        | similar in syntax    |
| 2016 | Python   | Lua         | dynamically typed    |
| 2015 | Erlang   | V           | interesting          |
