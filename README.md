# Advent of Code

Each year I use (or at least try to use) different programming language

## Plans

Note: the list (and order) can change

Other possible languages: Elm / D / Odin / Julia / OCaml / Clojure

Rather not: Janet / Perl / C#

| Year | Language | Alternative | Note                 |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| 2022 | Nim      | Pony        | interesting          |
| 2021 | Rust     | Zig         | relatively low-level |
| 2020 | Go       | Dart        | created by Google    |
| 2019 | Elixir   | TypeScript  | interesting          |
| 2018 | Kotlin   | Scala       | Java derivatives     |
| 2017 | Crystal  | Ruby        | similar in syntax    |
| 2016 | Python   | Lua         | dynamically typed    |
| 2015 | Erlang   | V           | interesting          |
